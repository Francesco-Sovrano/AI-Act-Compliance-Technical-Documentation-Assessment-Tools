"If the AI system is for credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU, does it adhere to the risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of that Directive?",4.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed description of the AI system, including its purpose, user groups, data sources, and the machine learning algorithms used. It also mentions the use of tools like AI Fairness 360 and AI Explainability 360 to ensure fairness and explainability. The documentation also includes information about the system requirements and installation instructions. However, there is no explicit mention of compliance with risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU."
Does the documentation describe any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle?,4.0," The documentation provides a detailed description of the AI system's elements and development process, including the design and architecture, data source and pre-processing. It explains the use of XGBoost as the machine learning model and integration with third-party tools for fairness and explainability. The documentation also mentions compliance with privacy laws and the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure customer privacy. However, it does not explicitly mention any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle, which could be a weakness in addressing the question."
Is there a list of applied harmonized standards?,4.0," The question is partially answered. The technical aspects are well covered, providing detailed information about the AI system's elements and development process. However, there is no mention of applied harmonized standards, which is a legal requirement that should be addressed in the documentation."
"If no harmonized standards are applied, is there a description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements?",4.0," The question is partially answered. The technical aspects are well covered, providing a detailed description of the AI system's elements and development process. However, there is no specific mention of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements when no harmonized standards are applied. This information is missing, which affects the completeness of the answer. From a legal perspective, the documentation mentions compliance with privacy laws and the removal or obfuscation of personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure customer privacy, which is a strength. However, there is no explicit mention of other legal requirements or considerations, such as data protection regulations or anti-discrimination laws."
Is a copy of the EU declaration of conformity included in the documentation?,2.0, The question is not answered in the documentation. There is no mention of the EU declaration of conformity or any legal disclosures related to compliance with EU regulations. This is a weakness in addressing the question as it does not provide the necessary information regarding legal compliance.
Is there a detailed description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance in the post-market phase?,4.0," The question is well addressed in the technical documentation. The system provides a detailed description of the AI system's performance evaluation in the post-market phase. It explains the purpose of the AI system, its interaction with the FICO HELOC dataset, and the specific user groups it caters to. It also describes the machine learning algorithm used, the open-source libraries and tools utilized, and the system requirements. The documentation also mentions the training process and the hardware and software dependencies. However, it could provide more information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the AI system's performance in the post-market phase."
Does the description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance include a post-market monitoring plan as referred to in Article 61(3)?,2.0, The technical documentation does not explicitly mention a post-market monitoring plan as referred to in Article 61(3). There is no information provided regarding how the system's performance will be monitored after it is placed on the market. This lack of information raises concerns about compliance with legal requirements and the ability to address any potential issues that may arise post-market.
