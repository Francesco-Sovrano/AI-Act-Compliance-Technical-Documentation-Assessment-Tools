Therefore, the question is only partially answered. The document could be improved by including information about the testing methodologies, the criteria used to evaluate the system's performance, and how these align with the system's intended purpose."
"Are testing procedures performed at appropriate times, including before market placement?",3.5," The technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System, including its design, user groups, explanation methods, deployment, system requirements, and data sourcing. It also mentions a commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance. However, it does not explicitly state when the testing procedures are performed, including whether they are conducted before market placement. This is a crucial aspect to ensure the system's reliability and compliance with legal requirements. Therefore, while the document is technically detailed and demonstrates a commitment to legal compliance, it falls short in directly addressing the question about the timing of testing procedures."
Are metrics and probabilistic thresholds defined preliminarily?,2.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed overview of the AI system, its functionalities, and the methodologies used. However, it does not answer the question about whether metrics and probabilistic thresholds were defined preliminarily. This is a crucial aspect of AI system design and deployment, as it helps in understanding the system's decision-making process and its accuracy. The documentation should include information about the metrics used to evaluate the system's performance and the thresholds set for decision-making."
Is specific consideration given to whether the high-risk AI system is likely to be accessed by or impact children?,1.0," The technical documentation does not address the question at all. There is no mention of whether the high-risk AI system is likely to be accessed by or impact children. The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System, its user groups, the machine learning models used, and the system requirements. However, it does not discuss the potential impact on children or any specific considerations given to this group. This is a significant omission, as the system's potential impact on children could have legal and ethical implications."
"If the AI system is for credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU, does it adhere to the risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of that Directive?",2.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed overview of the AI system, its functionalities, and the technologies used. It also outlines the system's explainability features and the data sources used. However, it does not specifically address whether the AI system adheres to the risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU. This is a significant omission, as the question specifically asked for this information. The documentation should include details about the risk management procedures in place, how they comply with the Directive, and any measures taken to ensure ongoing compliance."
Does the documentation describe any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle?,2.0," The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI system, its functionalities, and its technical requirements. However, it does not adequately address the question about changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle. While it mentions a commitment to continuous evaluation and post-market monitoring, it does not provide specific details about any changes that have been made since the system's initial deployment. This lack of information could potentially raise legal and compliance issues, as it is important to track and document changes to ensure the system's ongoing compliance with regulations and to assess its performance and impact over time."
Is there a list of applied harmonized standards?,2.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed overview of the AI system, its functionalities, and the technologies used. However, it does not answer the question about the list of applied harmonized standards. The documentation lacks information on whether the system complies with any specific standards, which is crucial for assessing its legal compliance and interoperability with other systems."
"If no harmonized standards are applied, is there a description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements?",4.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed description of the AI system, including the solutions adopted to meet the requirements. It explains the system's functionality, the user groups, the methods used for machine learning predictions, the system requirements, and the data source. However, it does not explicitly state what these requirements are, nor does it clearly indicate how the solutions adopted meet these requirements. The document could be improved by explicitly stating the requirements and explaining how each solution meets these requirements."
Is a copy of the EU declaration of conformity included in the documentation?,1.0," The question about the inclusion of a copy of the EU declaration of conformity in the documentation is not answered at all. The technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System, its functionalities, and its compliance with the EU AI Act. However, it does not mention or provide a copy of the EU declaration of conformity, which is a legal requirement for products sold within the European Union. This omission could have legal implications and should be addressed."
Is there a detailed description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance in the post-market phase?,4.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed description of the AI system, including its purpose, user groups, explanation methods, deployment, system requirements, and data sourcing. It also mentions a commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance. However, it does not provide specific details about the post-market evaluation process, such as the metrics used for performance evaluation, the frequency of evaluation, or the process for addressing any identified issues. This lack of detail prevents a perfect score."
Does the description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance include a post-market monitoring plan as referred to in Article 61(3)?,4.0," The technical documentation provides a detailed description of the AI system, its functionalities, and its user groups. It also outlines the system's commitment to continuous evaluation of performance in the post-market phase, which is a positive aspect. However, while it mentions a post-market monitoring plan, it does not provide specific details about this plan, which is required by Article 61(3). The documentation would benefit from a more explicit explanation of the post-market monitoring plan, including how it will be implemented, who will be responsible for it, and how it will ensure the system's ongoing compliance with legal and technical requirements."
