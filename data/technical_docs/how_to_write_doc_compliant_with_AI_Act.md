# How to write software documentation compliant with the AI Act

From the Annex IV of the EU AI Act, it's clear that this regulation seeks to provide a comprehensive framework to ensure the transparency, safety, and accountability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Here is a breakdown of its key requirements, which your technical documentation should align with:

**1. General Description of the AI System**
   - You need to provide a general description of your AI system, including its intended purpose, the developers, date, and version of the system.
   - You need to describe how your AI system interacts with other hardware or software, where applicable.
   - You need to state the versions of relevant software or firmware, and any requirement related to version updates.
   - You need to describe how the AI system is placed on the market or put into service, and the hardware it's intended to run on.
   - If the AI system is a component of other products, provide photographs or illustrations of those products.
   - Include instructions for use and installation instructions, where applicable.

**2. Detailed Description of the AI System's Elements and Development Process**
   - Provide detailed descriptions of the methods and steps performed during the development of the AI system. This includes the use of pre-trained systems or tools provided by third parties.
   - Describe the system's design specifications, general logic, algorithms, key design choices, classification choices, optimization parameters, and any possible trade-off made regarding technical solutions adopted to comply with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2 of the EU AI Act.
   - Describe the system architecture, computational resources used, and the data requirements, including training methodologies, techniques, and datasets used.
   - Assess the human oversight measures needed and provide a detailed description of predetermined changes to the AI system and its performance.
   - Describe the validation and testing procedures used, including metrics for measuring accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, and compliance with other relevant requirements.

**3. Detailed Information about the Monitoring, Functioning, and Control of the AI System**
   - Provide detailed information on the system's capabilities, limitations, potential unintended outcomes, sources of risks, and the human oversight measures needed.
   - Specify input data, as appropriate.

**4. Detailed Description of the Risk Management System**
   - Describe the risk management system in accordance with Article 9 of the EU AI Act.

**5. Description of Any Change Made to the System through its Lifecycle**
   - Document any changes made to the AI system throughout its lifecycle.

**6. List of the Harmonised Standards Applied**
   - List any harmonised standards applied, or if none were applied, provide a detailed description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2 of the EU AI Act.

**7. Copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity**
   - Include a copy of the EU declaration of conformity.

**8. Detailed Description of the System in Place to Evaluate the AI System Performance in the Post-market Phase**
   - Describe the system in place to evaluate the AI system's performance after it has been released on the market, including the post-market monitoring plan.

To make your technical documentation compliant, make sure it contains all the information required in this annex. This will likely involve adding new sections to your documentation or expanding existing ones. Remember, the goal of this regulation is to ensure the transparency and accountability of AI systems, so providing thorough, clear, and accurate information is crucial.

To structure a technical documentation that complies with Annex IV of the EU AI Act, it should follow a format that systematically covers all the areas outlined in the regulation. Here's a possible structure:

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the AI system.
   - Intended purpose of the AI system.
   - Information about the developers, the date, and the version of the system.

2. **General Description of the AI System**
   - Interaction with other hardware or software.
   - Versions of relevant software or firmware.
   - Description of the AI system's deployment (how it's placed on the market or put into service).
   - Description of the hardware the AI system is intended to run on.
   - If applicable, visual representation (photographs or illustrations) of products containing the AI system.
   - User and installation instructions.

3. **Detailed Description of the AI System's Elements and Development Process**
   - Methods and steps used for the development.
   - Design specifications including the logic of the AI system and algorithms used.
   - Key design choices and assumptions made.
   - Description of system architecture and computational resources used.
   - Description of the data requirements, training methodologies, and techniques.
   - Assessment of the necessary human oversight measures.
   - Description of predetermined changes to the AI system and its performance.

4. **Validation and Testing Procedures**
   - Information about the validation and testing data used.
   - Metrics used to measure accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, and compliance with other requirements.
   - Test logs and reports.

5. **Monitoring, Functioning, and Control of the AI System**
   - Information on the system's capabilities and limitations.
   - Potential unintended outcomes and sources of risks.
   - Specifications on input data, as appropriate.

6. **Risk Management System**
   - Detailed description of the risk management system in accordance with Article 9 of the EU AI Act.

7. **Lifecycle Changes**
   - Description of any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle.

8. **Harmonised Standards and Compliance**
   - List of any harmonised standards applied.
   - Description of solutions adopted to meet the requirements if no harmonised standards were applied.
   - Copy of the EU declaration of conformity.

9. **Post-market Monitoring**
   - Detailed description of the system for evaluating the AI system's performance in the post-market phase.
   - Description of the post-market monitoring plan.

Remember that the goal of this structure is to ensure that all information required by the EU AI Act is included in the technical documentation. It's essential to provide comprehensive, clear, and accurate information to ensure transparency and accountability.
