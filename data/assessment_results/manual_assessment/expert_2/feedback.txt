Thank you for sharing the project! I think it’s going to be really helpful for providers, since during the Grand Challenge they all said that they needed more guidance. I’ve attached the checklist with some comments. Some are about updates to Annex IV—obviously they won’t be relevant if we’re restricting it to the original proposal, but they seemed worth mentioning. Others are about the wording of the questions—some could be more about what’s listed in the technical documentation rather than what happened during the development. 
The first one (credit) I read first and then went through the checklist, which took 50-60 minutes. The medical application I went through the checklist as I read the doc, which took ~30 minutes. 
Let me know if any of my comments aren't clear! Also happy to pitch in on drafting/reviewing if that would be helpful.
