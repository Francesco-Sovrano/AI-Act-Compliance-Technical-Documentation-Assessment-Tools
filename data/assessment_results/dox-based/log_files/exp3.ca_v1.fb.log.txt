We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer.

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",

It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer.

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer.

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer.

These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk.

    "Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer.

    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The following sections detail the specifics of the AI-based Credit Approval System: 1. **Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training** 2. **Explainability Features** 3. **Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase** 4. **Post-Market Monitoring Plan**",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "Each section includes a detailed account of our procedures, methodologies, and commitments, providing clear insights into our AI system's operations. By the end of this document, readers should have a thorough understanding of how our Credit Approval AI System functions, how it meets the EU AI Act's requirements, and how we plan to maintain and improve its performance post-deployment.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation describes the methods and steps performed for the development of the AI system. The AI system's development process begins with data preprocessing, which involves data cleaning, feature selection, data normalization, and data bias reduction (paragraph 17). The training phase involves fitting models to the training dataset, with XGBoost being the primary predictive model used (paragraph 11). The system is then tested for robustness, accuracy, and performance (paragraph 2). The system's performance is monitored in real-world scenarios, and any errors or anomalies are noted (paragraph 2). Comprehensive reports on the system's performance are generated, including any issues identified and corrective actions taken (paragraph 2). The AI system is periodically updated and maintained based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing (paragraph 3). The development of the AI system is tracked and audited using GitHub, with every change being logged and timestamped (paragraph 1).

<Question> Are there sections detailing the use of any pre-trained systems or third-party tools?
<Answers> [
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance.",
    "The training phase involves fitting our models to the training dataset. The primary predictive model used in our AI system is XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework renowned for its efficiency and performance.",
    "It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset.",
    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized. It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct.",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "It also includes several advanced libraries and tools to guarantee reliable and highly accurate results.",
    "Let's dive into the specifics of our AI system, beginning with our data source and how we preprocess and train our models. ## Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training",
    "In this section, we provide details about the origin of our data, the techniques we use to preprocess it, and the methodologies followed during model training. It is crucial to note that all these procedures strictly adhere to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines. ### Data Source",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. This partitioning enables us to train our models effectively and evaluate their performance objectively: 1. **Training Set:** The majority of the data (around 70%) is used to train our models. 2. **Validation Set:** A portion of the data (around 15%) is set aside to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. 3. **Testing Set:** The remaining data (approximately 15%) is used to test the model's performance on unseen data, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.",
    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized.",
    "The system is primarily deployed by loan officers to assess credit eligibility and determine the credit quantum. It predicts the likelihood of punctual payments over a period of two years using data derived from credit reports. Our system is built on the IBM AIX360 platform and leverages the robustness and accuracy of the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. It also includes several advanced libraries and tools to guarantee reliable and highly accurate results.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "The XGBoost model is trained on the pre-processed and normalized data, with its performance evaluated using subset accuracy, as calculated by the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements."

    "To ensure transparency and explainability in our credit approval decisions, we use three different explanatory models: BooleanRuleCG, LogisticRuleRegression, and Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM). These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",

]
<Final Answer> Yes, the design specifications, including the general logic and algorithms, are clearly outlined. The system uses three different explanatory models: BooleanRuleCG, LogisticRuleRegression, and Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM) to ensure transparency and explainability in credit approval decisions (paragraph 2). The BooleanRuleCG algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm, while the LogisticRuleRegression algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features. The Generalized Linear Rule Model extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships (paragraph 2). The system is built on the IBM AIX360 platform and leverages the robustness and accuracy of the XGBoost machine learning algorithm (paragraph 3). The documentation also provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized (paragraph 1, 8).

    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",

<Question> Are the data requirements including datasheets, training methodologies, and data sets described?
<Answers> [
    "These requirements may be subject to changes depending on the system configuration and the volume of data involved.",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. This partitioning enables us to train our models effectively and evaluate their performance objectively: 1. **Training Set:** The majority of the data (around 70%) is used to train our models. 2. **Validation Set:** A portion of the data (around 15%) is set aside to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. 3. **Testing Set:** The remaining data (approximately 15%) is used to test the model's performance on unseen data, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.",
    "This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set.",
    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized. It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act.",
    "In this section, we provide details about the origin of our data, the techniques we use to preprocess it, and the methodologies followed during model training. It is crucial to note that all these procedures strictly adhere to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines. ### Data Source",
    "We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model.",
    "The following are the system requirements for the AI-based Credit Approval System: - Operating System: Compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS. - Processor: A minimum requirement of an Intel Core i5 processor. - RAM: At least 8 GB for optimal performance. - Storage: A minimum of 100 GB of free disk space. - Graphics Card: A dedicated Nvidia graphics card, such as Nvidia A100. - Internet Connection: A stable connection for seamless API access. - Additional Software: Python 3.6 or later, CUDA 10.0, and cuDNN 7.6.5 or later.",
    "The dataset consists of anonymized customer data, including credit history, income levels, employment status, and other relevant financial details.",
    "We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "The credit approval system uses the FICO HELOC dataset as its primary data source. The dataset consists of anonymized customer data, including credit history, income levels, employment status, and other relevant financial details. The dataset is composed of a diverse range of customers who have requested a credit line in the range of USD 5,000 - 150,000, which is typically offered by US banks as a percentage of home equity.",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set.",
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance.",
    "Let's dive into the specifics of our AI system, beginning with our data source and how we preprocess and train our models.",
    "The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements."

<Final Answer> Yes, the data requirements including datasheets, training methodologies, and data sets are described. The data source is the FICO HELOC dataset, which consists of anonymized customer data, including credit history, income levels, employment status, and other relevant financial details (paragraph 14). The data is preprocessed and then split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set (paragraph 1). The training set is used to train the models, the validation set is used to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to test the model's performance on unseen data (paragraph 1). The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm for model training (paragraph 16). The system's performance is continuously evaluated, including testing with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set (paragraph 2, 19).

<Question> Is there an assessment of human oversight measures as per Article 14?
<Answers> [
    "The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct.",
    "These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security.",
    "Regular reports are generated detailing the system's performance, any identified issues or incidents, and any corrective actions taken. These reports are shared with relevant regulatory bodies as required. All activities related to post-market monitoring are thoroughly documented, creating a comprehensive record of the system's performance and compliance with regulations. ### Updates and Maintenance",

    "By following these steps and utilizing the aif360 toolkit, we can ensure that our credit approval system is fair and unbiased, reducing the risk of discrimination and promoting ethical and responsible use of AI-based systems.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

<Answers> [
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",

The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "We have identified three primary user groups for our system: data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers. Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "We demonstrate a different way of explaining machine learning predictions by showing examples.",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",

<Question> Do the human oversight measures help individuals detect and address signs of anomalies, dysfunctions, and unexpected performance as soon as possible?
<Answers> [
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities. By observing trends and patterns in the data, we can proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's performance. ### Regular Testing",
    "The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken.",
    "The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "In the event of any significant issues or incidents, a response plan is activated. This plan includes immediate measures to mitigate any harmful effects, an investigation into the cause of the incident, and long-term measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. ### Reporting and Documentation",
    "Regular reports are generated detailing the system's performance, any identified issues or incidents, and any corrective actions taken. These reports are shared with relevant regulatory bodies as required. All activities related to post-market monitoring are thoroughly documented, creating a comprehensive record of the system's performance and compliance with regulations. ### Updates and Maintenance",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",

<Question> Are measures in place to ensure individuals remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by the high-risk AI system?
<Answers> [
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems.",
    "By implementing this post-market monitoring plan, we aim to ensure that our AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act. We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities. By observing trends and patterns in the data, we can proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's performance. ### Regular Testing",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan. This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation. ### Data Collection",
    "We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan."

<Final Answer> Yes, measures are in place to ensure individuals remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by the high-risk AI system. The AI system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct (paragraph 2 and 5). The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood (paragraph 2). They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary (paragraph 2). The system's post-market performance is evaluated according to ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards (paragraph 3). The lifecycle of the system includes monitoring, testing, and reporting stages (paragraph 4). The system is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly (paragraph 8). The system's performance data is collected and analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities (paragraph 13).

<Question> Do the measures enable individuals to correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output?
<Answers> [
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "Each section includes a detailed account of our procedures, methodologies, and commitments, providing clear insights into our AI system's operations. By the end of this document, readers should have a thorough understanding of how our Credit Approval AI System functions, how it meets the EU AI Act's requirements, and how we plan to maintain and improve its performance post-deployment.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management.",
    "Let's dive into the specifics of our AI system, beginning with our data source and how we preprocess and train our models. ## Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training",
    "Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "We have identified three primary user groups for our system: data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers. Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "Each section includes a detailed account of our procedures, methodologies, and commitments, providing clear insights into our AI system's operations.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "By following these steps and utilizing the aif360 toolkit, we can ensure that our credit approval system is fair and unbiased, reducing the risk of discrimination and promoting ethical and responsible use of AI-based systems.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "This real-world data is invaluable for understanding the system's performance in various scenarios and identifying areas for improvement.",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities."

<Question> Can individuals decide not to use the high-risk AI system, or otherwise disregard, override, or reverse the output of the AI system?
<Answers> [
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "By following these steps and utilizing the aif360 toolkit, we can ensure that our credit approval system is fair and unbiased, reducing the risk of discrimination and promoting ethical and responsible use of AI-based systems.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",

    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "By implementing this post-market monitoring plan, we aim to ensure that our AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act. We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",

<Question> Are validation and testing procedures clearly defined, along with used metrics and test logs?
<Answers> [
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. This partitioning enables us to train our models effectively and evaluate their performance objectively: 1. **Training Set:** The majority of the data (around 70%) is used to train our models. 2. **Validation Set:** A portion of the data (around 15%) is set aside to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. 3. **Testing Set:** The remaining data (approximately 15%) is used to test the model's performance on unseen data, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.",
    "These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized. It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model.",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security. If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent. ### Incident Response",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "We train the XGBoost model using the training set, tuning its hyperparameters using the validation set to avoid overfitting and underfitting. The model's performance is evaluated using the subset accuracy metric, as calculated by the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function.",

These reports are shared with relevant regulatory bodies as required. All activities related to post-market monitoring are thoroughly documented, creating a comprehensive record of the system's performance and compliance with regulations. ### Updates and Maintenance",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities. By observing trends and patterns in the data, we can proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's performance. ### Regular Testing",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan. This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation. ### Data Collection",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation.",

<Question> Does the documentation detail the capabilities and limitations of the AI system?
<Answers> [
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance.",
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "It's capable of handling a large number of features, is robust to outliers in the data, and can model complex non-linear relationships.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The following are the system requirements for the AI-based Credit Approval System: - Operating System: Compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS. - Processor: A minimum requirement of an Intel Core i5 processor. - RAM: At least 8 GB for optimal performance. - Storage: A minimum of 100 GB of free disk space. - Graphics Card: A dedicated Nvidia graphics card, such as Nvidia A100. - Internet Connection: A stable connection for seamless API access. - Additional Software: Python 3.6 or later, CUDA 10.0, and cuDNN 7.6.5 or later.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "The following sections detail the specifics of the AI-based Credit Approval System: 1. **Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training** 2. **Explainability Features** 3. **Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase** 4. **Post-Market Monitoring Plan**",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems.",
    "Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "Let's dive into the specifics of our AI system, beginning with our data source and how we preprocess and train our models. ## Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training",
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance.",
    "Each section includes a detailed account of our procedures, methodologies, and commitments, providing clear insights into our AI system's operations. By the end of this document, readers should have a thorough understanding of how our Credit Approval AI System functions, how it meets the EU AI Act's requirements, and how we plan to maintain and improve its performance post-deployment.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "It has consistently outperformed other popular machine learning algorithms in various data science competitions and real-world applications."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation details the capabilities and limitations of the AI system. The AI system's capabilities include handling large datasets with many features, robustness to outliers, modeling complex non-linear relationships (paragraph 3), and providing a high degree of explainability (paragraph 5). The system also incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure correct outputs and can be adjusted as necessary during deployment (paragraph 5). The system's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which provides a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios (paragraph 16). The system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions (paragraph 17). The limitations of the system are not explicitly stated, but the documentation mentions a lifecycle for evaluating the system's performance, which includes monitoring, testing, and reporting phases (paragraph 0). This suggests that the system is continuously monitored and tested for any issues, and any identified issues are reported and corrective actions are taken (paragraph 0).

<Question> Is there information on the degrees of accuracy for specific target groups?
<Answers> [
    "The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69.",
    "The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",
    "This approach ensures that our model is more accurate.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the subset accuracy metric, as calculated by the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function.",
    "We have identified three primary user groups for our system: data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers. Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "To ensure transparency and explainability in our credit approval decisions, we use three different explanatory models: BooleanRuleCG, LogisticRuleRegression, and Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM). These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management.",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security. If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent. ### Incident Response",
    "These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. This partitioning enables us to train our models effectively and evaluate their performance objectively: 1. **Training Set:** The majority of the data (around 70%) is used to train our models. 2. **Validation Set:** A portion of the data (around 15%) is set aside to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. 3. **Testing Set:** The remaining data (approximately 15%) is used to test the model's performance on unseen data, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.",
    "The XGBoost model is trained on the pre-processed and normalized data, with its performance evaluated using subset accuracy, as calculated by the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function. Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back). This approach ensures that our model is more accurate. ## Explainability Features",
    "It also includes several advanced libraries and tools to guarantee reliable and highly accurate results.",
    "This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed.",
    "The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group.",
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance.",
    "The credit approval system uses the FICO HELOC dataset as its primary data source. The dataset consists of anonymized customer data, including credit history, income levels, employment status, and other relevant financial details. The dataset is composed of a diverse range of customers who have requested a credit line in the range of USD 5,000 - 150,000, which is typically offered by US banks as a percentage of home equity."

<Question> Is there evidence that a risk management system has been established, implemented, documented, and maintained for high-risk AI systems?
<Answers> [
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "By implementing this post-market monitoring plan, we aim to ensure that our AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act. We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan.",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan. This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation. ### Data Collection",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The AI-based credit approval system is designed to continually learn and improve from the new data it encounters post-deployment. To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "**Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase** 4.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "The following are the system requirements for the AI-based Credit Approval System: - Operating System: Compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS. - Processor: A minimum requirement of an Intel Core i5 processor.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",

The AI-based Credit Approval System designed by the company falls under the high-risk category of AI-based systems and is designed in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act (paragraph 2). A lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase, which includes monitoring, testing, and reporting stages (paragraph 3, 5, 12). The system is also subjected to regular testing and updates based on the findings from data analysis (paragraph 14, 18). The company also implements a robust post-market monitoring plan to ensure the system's ongoing performance and compliance (paragraph 7, 9). The system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 27001, which provide guidelines for software quality measurement and information security management, respectively (paragraph 1).

<Question> Does the documentation indicate that the risk management system is a continuous iterative process run throughout the entire lifecycle of the high-risk AI system?
<Answers> [
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "The AI-based credit approval system is designed to continually learn and improve from the new data it encounters post-deployment. To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",

    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized. It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan. This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation. ### Data Collection",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "The following sections detail the specifics of the AI-based Credit Approval System: 1. **Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training** 2. **Explainability Features** 3. **Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase** 4. **Post-Market Monitoring Plan**",
    "The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems.",
    "By implementing this post-market monitoring plan, we aim to ensure that our AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act. We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "The training phase involves fitting our models to the training dataset. The primary predictive model used in our AI system is XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework renowned for its efficiency and performance.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination.",

<Question> Are known and foreseeable risks associated with the high-risk AI system identified and analyzed?
<Answers> [
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities.",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability. We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "A key feature of our AI system is its explainability.",
    "By following these steps and utilizing the aif360 toolkit, we can ensure that our credit approval system is fair and unbiased, reducing the risk of discrimination and promoting ethical and responsible use of AI-based systems.",
    "This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act.",
    "The use of multiple explanatory models allows us to cross-verify the explanations and ensure their reliability. This is particularly important in high-stakes contexts like credit approval, where understanding the reasons behind decisions can have significant impacts.",
    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "The primary predictive model used in our AI system is XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework renowned for its efficiency and performance.",
    "The system relies on the IBM AIX360 platform and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict creditworthiness. It also utilizes a diverse range of libraries such as joblib, scikit-learn, torch, torchvision, cvxpy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, xgboost, bleach, docutils, and Pygments. The model underwent an intensive training period of approximately 8 hours on 8x NVIDIA A100 to ensure optimal performance.",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables"
]
<Final Answer> Yes, known and foreseeable risks associated with the high-risk AI system are identified and analyzed. The lifecycle of the AI system comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. During the monitoring phase, data on the system's real-world performance is gathered, including system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken (paragraph 1). The data collected is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities (paragraph 5). Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained (paragraph 10). The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly (paragraph 19).

<Final Answer> Yes, the risk management system includes evaluation of risks based on data gathered from post-market monitoring. The post-market monitoring plan is designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation (paragraph 0). During the monitoring phase, data on the system's real-world performance is gathered, including system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur (paragraph 6). Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities (paragraph 18). The system is also regularly tested using the newly collected data to assess its accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security (paragraph 8).

These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk.",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security. If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent. ### Incident Response",
    "In addition to these XAI tools, we use GitHub to track and audit the development of our AI system. Every change is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability. We also keep third-party tools up to date and ensure their security to maintain the system's high standards and comply with all relevant regulations. ## Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase",
    "This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation.",
    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "The target variable, Risk Performance, is a binary variable that indicates whether an applicant was 90 days past due or worse at least once over a period of 24 months from when the credit account was opened.",
    "We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",

<Final Answer> Yes, suitable risk management measures are adopted. In the event of significant issues or incidents, a response plan is activated which includes immediate measures to mitigate any harmful effects, an investigation into the cause of the incident, and long-term measures to prevent similar incidents in the future (paragraph 0). The AI system's post-market performance is evaluated based on ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards, ensuring regulatory compliance and reliable performance (paragraph 2). A robust post-market monitoring plan is in place to ensure ongoing performance and compliance of the AI-based credit approval system (paragraph 4). This plan includes regular reports detailing the system's performance, any identified issues or incidents, and any corrective actions taken (paragraph 6). The system is regularly tested for accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security using newly collected data (paragraph 13). The lifecycle of the system comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting (paragraph 11). All these measures aim to ensure that the AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act (paragraph 9).

    "It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation shows evidence of elimination or reduction of risks through adequate design and development. The data collected is systematically analyzed to identify potential issues such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities (paragraph 1, 5). In the event of significant issues or incidents, a response plan is activated which includes immediate measures to mitigate any harmful effects, an investigation into the cause of the incident, and long-term measures to prevent similar incidents in the future (paragraph 0, 2). The model is also trained to minimize the risk of false negatives and balance the risk of false positives (paragraph 3). The system's performance is continuously evaluated in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance (paragraph 8, 12). The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management (paragraph 10).

<Answers> [
    "In this section, we provide details about the origin of our data, the techniques we use to preprocess it, and the methodologies followed during model training. It is crucial to note that all these procedures strictly adhere to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines. ### Data Source",
    "Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "We have identified three primary user groups for our system: data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers. Each user group has unique needs and the system accordingly provides tailored explanation methods for machine learning predictions.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space.",
    "To ensure transparency and explainability in our credit approval decisions, we use three different explanatory models: BooleanRuleCG, LogisticRuleRegression, and Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM). These models help us understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by our XGBoost model. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72.",
    "This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model.",
    "The XGBoost model is trained on the pre-processed and normalized data, with its performance evaluated using subset accuracy, as calculated by the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function. Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).

It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future.",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security.

    "The following sections detail the specifics of the AI-based Credit Approval System: 1. **Data Source, Pre-processing, and Training** 2. **Explainability Features** 3. **Lifecycle for Evaluating AI System Performance in the Post-Market Phase** 4. **Post-Market Monitoring Plan**",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "The AI-based credit approval system is designed to continually learn and improve from the new data it encounters post-deployment. To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities. By observing trends and patterns in the data, we can proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's performance. ### Regular Testing"

<Final Answer> Yes, high-risk AI systems are tested to identify the most appropriate risk management measures. The lifecycle of these systems comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. During the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security. If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent (paragraph 1, paragraph 15).

<Final Answer> Yes, testing procedures do ensure consistent performance and compliance. The system is regularly tested for accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security (paragraph 1). If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent (paragraph 0). The evaluation of the system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 27001, which ensure regulatory compliance and reliable performance (paragraph 3). The system is also regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly, enabling it to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act (paragraph 6). Furthermore, every change in the system is logged and timestamped to ensure transparency and accountability (paragraph 8).

The system is also tested with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set (paragraph 4). The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which provides a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios (paragraph 12). All these procedures strictly adhere to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines (paragraph 8, 15).

<Question> Are testing procedures performed at appropriate times, including before market placement?
<Answers> [
    "If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent.",
    "The system is regularly tested using the newly collected data. These tests assess the system's accuracy, fairness, robustness, and security. If there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape, additional tests are conducted to ensure the system's performance remains consistent. ### Incident Response",
    "They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination.",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan. This plan comprises several components, which are designed to collect and analyze performance data, assess the system's ongoing performance, and facilitate reporting and documentation. ### Data Collection",
    "Ensuring the ongoing performance and compliance of our AI-based credit approval system post-deployment requires a robust post-market monitoring plan.",
    "Once collected, the data is systematically analyzed to identify any potential issues, such as declining performance, bias in decision-making, or security vulnerabilities. By observing trends and patterns in the data, we can proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's performance. ### Regular Testing",
    "The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. The model is regularly monitored and updated to detect and address emerging biases promptly. This monitoring process also enables the system to adapt to changing trends and operate in compliance with the EU AI Act. ### Dataset Variables",
    "This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set.",
    "After pre-processing, the data is split into three distinct sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. This partitioning enables us to train our models effectively and evaluate their performance objectively: 1. **Training Set:** The majority of the data (around 70%) is used to train our models. 2. **Validation Set:** A portion of the data (around 15%) is set aside to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. 3. **Testing Set:** The remaining data (approximately 15%) is used to test the model's performance on unseen data, which gives us a realistic measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.",
    "To ensure that the system maintains its performance and complies with the EU AI Act requirements, a lifecycle has been established to evaluate its performance in the post-market phase.",
    "By implementing this post-market monitoring plan, we aim to ensure that our AI-based credit approval system continues to deliver reliable performance and meets the high standards set by the EU AI Act. We believe that through constant monitoring, testing, and improvement, we can provide a system that is not only effective but also trustworthy and transparent.",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management. Adherence to these standards ensures the system maintains regulatory compliance and delivers reliable performance. ## Post-Market Monitoring Plan",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "Regular reports are generated detailing the system's performance, any identified issues or incidents, and any corrective actions taken. These reports are shared with relevant regulatory bodies as required. All activities related to post-market monitoring are thoroughly documented, creating a comprehensive record of the system's performance and compliance with regulations. ### Updates and Maintenance",
    "This documentation provides detailed information about the system, from data sourcing and preprocessing to the predictive and explanatory models utilized. It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "It also outlines our commitment to continuous evaluation of the system's performance in the post-market phase for regulatory compliance.",
    "We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets.",
    "Based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing, the AI system will be periodically updated and maintained. These updates might include changes to the machine learning model, the data processing methods, or the user interface. ### Stakeholder Feedback",
    "We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, testing procedures are performed at appropriate times, including before market placement. Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, a pre-processing phase is followed to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination (paragraph 3). After pre-processing, the data is split into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set, which is used to test the model's performance on unseen data (paragraph 9). The system is regularly tested using newly collected data, and additional tests are conducted if there are significant changes in the credit market or regulatory landscape (paragraph 1). The system is also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary (paragraph 2). Furthermore, a robust post-market monitoring plan is implemented to ensure the ongoing performance and compliance of the AI-based credit approval system (paragraph 4, 5). This plan includes regular testing and monitoring, and the system is updated based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing (paragraph 18).

    "XGBoost's ability to handle large datasets with many features and its flexibility to incorporate a variety of objective functions and evaluation metrics make it a popular choice for many high-risk AI-based systems, including our credit approval system.",
    "The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems.",
    "This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-based Credit Approval System designed by our company in adherence to the strict requirements of the EU AI Act. The system assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants, falling under the high-risk category of AI-based systems. Our objective is to ensure that our AI system is transparent, fair, and robust, while providing a high degree of explainability to both our internal teams and external stakeholders.",
    "By following these steps and utilizing the aif360 toolkit, we can ensure that our credit approval system is fair and unbiased, reducing the risk of discrimination and promoting ethical and responsible use of AI-based systems.",
    "Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.",
    "Our model is trained to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e., approving a loan for someone who will default) while balancing the risk of false positives (i.e., denying a loan to someone who would have paid it back).",
    "The evaluation of the AI system's post-market performance is guided by ISO/IEC 25012, which provides guidelines for software quality measurement, and ISO/IEC 27001, which provides guidelines for information security management.",

We believe it's essential for data scientists, loan officers, and bank customers to understand the reasoning behind the credit approval decisions made by the system. The system incorporates built-in human oversight to ensure that the outputs are correct. The models are designed to be transparent, so their workings can be easily understood. They are also monitored during deployment, and adjustments can be made as necessary.",
    "The lifecycle comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. **Monitoring.** During the monitoring phase, we gather data on the system's real-world performance. This includes system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies that might occur. **Testing.** In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data to ensure it can generalize well beyond the initial training set. **Reporting.** The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities, ensuring we maintain full transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",

    "Our system also supports XAI algorithms for explaining credit approval decisions to loan officers and bank customers. The algorithms we use are: * **ProtodashExplainer:** This XAI tool is for producing explanations for Loan Officers/employees. The ProtodashExplainer algorithm works with an existing predictive model to show how the customer compares to others who have similar profiles and had similar repayment records to the model's prediction for the current customer. It helps to evaluate and predict the applicant's risk. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. * **CEMExplainer:** This XAI tool is for Applicants/bank customers. The CEMExplainer algorithm sits on top of an existing predictive model and helps detect both the features that a bank customer could improve and also further detects the features that will increase the likelihood of approval and those that are within reach for the customer. It provides insight into what - if their application was rejected - they can improve in order to increase the likelihood it will be accepted in the future."

<Final Answer> Yes, there is a detailed description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance in the post-market phase. The lifecycle for evaluating the AI system's performance in the post-market phase comprises three stages: monitoring, testing, and reporting. During the monitoring phase, data on the system's real-world performance is gathered, including system inputs and outputs, user feedback, and any errors or anomalies. In the testing phase, the AI system is subjected to various scenarios to assess its robustness, accuracy, and performance. This includes testing the system with new, unseen data. The reporting phase involves generating comprehensive reports on the system's performance, including any issues identified during monitoring and testing, as well as any corrective actions taken. These reports are then submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities (paragraph 8). The system is also periodically updated and maintained based on the findings from data analysis and regular testing (paragraph 12). All activities related to post-market monitoring are thoroughly documented, creating a comprehensive record of the system's performance and compliance with regulations (paragraph 18).
