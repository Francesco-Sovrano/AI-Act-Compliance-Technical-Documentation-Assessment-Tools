2. ""The explanatory models are integrated into the main application through a REST API. The API can generate explanations on-demand for any credit decision made by the AI system. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72."",

The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting""

1. ""Article 14 of the EU AI Act specifies requirements for human oversight of AI systems. The objective is to ensure that human beings remain in control of the system's actions and can intervene or override decisions where necessary. For our credit approval AI system, we have implemented the following mechanisms for human oversight, along with the assessment criteria for each: #### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) **Mechanism**: In the credit approval process, critical decisions made by the AI system are reviewed by a loan officer. The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting"",

The objective is to ensure that human beings remain in control of the system's actions and can intervene or override decisions where necessary. For our credit approval AI system, we have implemented the following mechanisms for human oversight, along with the assessment criteria for each: #### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) **Mechanism**: In the credit approval process, critical decisions made by the AI system are reviewed by a loan officer. The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting"",
14. ""The routine performance evaluations are conducted on a quarterly basis, or as needed based on the ongoing monitoring results. The evaluations include an analysis of the system's accuracy and fairness metrics, a review of the system's credit approval decisions and their outcomes, and a comparison of the system's performance against other benchmark models or industry standards. ### Bias Detection and Mitigation"",
15. ""The explanatory models are integrated into the main application through a REST API. The API can generate explanations on-demand for any credit decision made by the AI system. 1. **BooleanRuleCG (BRCG):** The BooleanRuleCG (BRCG) algorithm generates a set of simple boolean rules using a genetic algorithm. These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms. The model output predicts the probability of repaying on time (Y=1). The training accuracy of the CEMExplainer algorithm is 0.73, and the test accuracy is 0.72."",

19. ""Before the data is used to train the credit approval AI model, we follow a pre-processing phase that involves several steps to ensure data quality, integrity, fairness, and non-discrimination. We describe these steps below: **Data Cleaning.** We begin by meticulously removing any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates in the credit approval dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. **Feature Selection.** We identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to a customer's creditworthiness using both domain knowledge and feature importance techniques. This process helps to ensure that only the most relevant features are used to train our model. **Data Normalization.** We normalize the data to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Normalizing the data helps our model to train more effectively and avoid bias towards any specific feature. This step is crucial in preventing bias towards specific features that may have a larger scale than others. **Data Bias Reduction.** To ensure fairness and non-discrimination in our credit approval system, we use the Reweighing algorithm to reduce bias in the training data. Specifically, we follow the steps below: 1. **Loading and Preparing Data:** We load the initial credit approval dataset and split it into training and testing datasets. We use the testing dataset to assess the accuracy, fairness, and other metrics during the development of the machine learning model. 2. **Computing Fairness Metric on Original Training Dataset:** We use the AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to compute the fairness metric on the original training dataset. We identify the protected attribute 'age' and define privileged and unprivileged values for that attribute. We then use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class to compare the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group. A negative value indicates less favorable outcomes for the unprivileged group. 3. **Mitigating Bias by Transforming the Original Dataset:** To mitigate bias in the training dataset, we use the Reweighing algorithm implemented in the Reweighing class in the aif360.algorithms.preprocessing package. This algorithm transforms the dataset to have more equity in positive outcomes on the protected attribute for the privileged and unprivileged groups. We use the fit and transform methods to perform the transformation, producing a newly transformed training dataset. 4. **Computing Fairness Metric on Transformed Dataset:** We use the mean_difference method on the BinaryLabelDatasetMetric class again to compute the fairness metric on the transformed training dataset. This metric indicates the percentage of favorable outcomes for each group after the dataset has been transformed. We see that the Reweighing algorithm was highly effective in removing bias, as the difference in mean outcomes is now 0.0. Therefore, there is no advantage for the privileged group.""

These rules can explain the decisions made by the predictive model, even for complex non-linear relationships. BRCG is designed to produce either a disjunctive normal form (DNF) or a conjunctive normal form (CNF) rule to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time. A DNF rule corresponds to an individual rule in the rule set, where the AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. The algorithm uses column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. The training accuracy of the BRCG model is 0.71, and the test accuracy is 0.69. 2. **LogisticRuleRegression (LRR):** The LogisticRuleRegression (LRR) algorithm fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features and is capable of generating interpretable rules that can explain the decision-making process. It uses column generation to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules, including unbinarized ordinal features in addition to rules. The complexity parameters lambda0 and lambda1 penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. The training accuracy of the LRR model is 0.74, and the test accuracy is 0.72. 3. **Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM):** The Generalized Linear Rule Model (GLRM) algorithm extends the rule-based explanatory model by allowing for more general linear relationships. It produces models that are weighted combinations of rules, which give insight into loan repayment predictability. The algorithm also has the option of combining rules with linear terms.

6. ""Article 14 of the EU AI Act specifies requirements for human oversight of AI systems. The objective is to ensure that human beings remain in control of the system's actions and can intervene or override decisions where necessary. For our credit approval AI system, we have implemented the following mechanisms for human oversight, along with the assessment criteria for each: #### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) **Mechanism**: In the credit approval process, critical decisions made by the AI system are reviewed by a loan officer. The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting"",

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) **Mechanism**: In the credit approval process, critical decisions made by the AI system are reviewed by a loan officer. The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting"",

7. ""Article 14 of the EU AI Act specifies requirements for human oversight of AI systems. The objective is to ensure that human beings remain in control of the system's actions and can intervene or override decisions where necessary. For our credit approval AI system, we have implemented the following mechanisms for human oversight, along with the assessment criteria for each: #### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) **Mechanism**: In the credit approval process, critical decisions made by the AI system are reviewed by a loan officer. The loan officer has the authority to overturn a decision if they find it to be erroneous or unjust. **Assessment**: The effectiveness of this mechanism is assessed by tracking the frequency and nature of overrides made by loan officers. Metrics such as the \""Override Rate\"" and \""Time-to-Override\"" are monitored. Feedback from loan officers about the system's decisions also contributes to the assessment. #### 2. Audit Trails **Mechanism**: Every decision made by the AI system, along with the underlying rationale as provided by the explainability features, is logged in an immutable audit trail. **Assessment**: Compliance officers periodically review the audit trails to ensure that all actions can be accounted for and can be traced back to a specific point in the decision-making process. The review includes checking the integrity and completeness of the log records. #### 3. Periodic Model Review **Mechanism**: Data scientists conduct a periodic review of the model to ensure it is performing as expected and not deviating from ethical or legal guidelines. **Assessment**: The model's performance metrics, along with fairness and bias metrics, are evaluated during these reviews. Any deviations trigger an in-depth investigation and, if necessary, model retraining. #### 4. User Feedback Loop **Mechanism**: Customers who undergo the credit approval process are encouraged to provide feedback, especially if they believe a decision was unfair or incorrect. **Assessment**: Customer feedback is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Metrics such as \""Customer Satisfaction Score\"" (CSAT) and \""Net Promoter Score\"" (NPS) are considered, along with narrative feedback for subjective analysis. #### 5. Emergency Off-Switch **Mechanism**: The system is equipped with an \""emergency off-switch\"" that can immediately halt the AI system's operations in case of malfunction or unexpected behavior. **Assessment**: The responsiveness and effectiveness of the off-switch are tested under simulated emergency conditions. The assessment also includes the time taken to engage the off-switch and the system's ability to safely and quickly transition control back to human operators. #### Assessment Schedule and Reporting"",
