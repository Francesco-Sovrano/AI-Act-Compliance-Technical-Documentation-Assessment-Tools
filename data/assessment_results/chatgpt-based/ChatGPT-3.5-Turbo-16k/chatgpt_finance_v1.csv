However, there is no explicit mention of specific consideration given to whether the high-risk AI system is likely to be accessed by or impact children. This aspect should be addressed to ensure compliance with legal requirements regarding the protection of children's data and rights."
"If the AI system is for credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU, does it adhere to the risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of that Directive?",4," The question is partially answered. The technical aspects are well covered, providing detailed information about the AI system's operations, data sourcing, preprocessing, and training. However, there is no explicit mention of adherence to the risk management procedures pursuant to Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU. The documentation could benefit from explicitly addressing how the AI system adheres to these risk management procedures and any specific measures taken to ensure compliance."
Does the documentation describe any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle?,4," The question is partially answered. The documentation provides detailed information about the data source, pre-processing, and training of the AI system. It describes the origin of the data, the steps taken to ensure data quality and integrity, and the techniques used to reduce bias and ensure fairness in the system. However, it does not explicitly mention any changes made to the system throughout its lifecycle, which could be a weakness in addressing the question."
Is there a list of applied harmonized standards?,4," The question is well addressed in the technical documentation. The documentation provides a clear and detailed account of the explainability features of the AI system for each user group. It describes the interpretable rule-based models for data scientists, the ProtoDash method for loan officers, and the Contrastive Explanations Method (CEM) for bank customers. The documentation also explains the system requirements and the training process, ensuring transparency and robustness. However, there is no specific mention of applied harmonized standards, which could be a potential weakness in addressing the question."
"If no harmonized standards are applied, is there a description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements?",4," The question is well addressed in the technical documentation. The documentation provides a detailed description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements. It explains the use of interpretable rule-based models for data scientists, the ProtoDash method for loan officers, and the Contrastive Explanations Method (CEM) for bank customers. It also describes the data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature selection, data normalization, and data bias reduction using the Reweighing algorithm. The documentation provides clear insights into the system's operations and how it meets the requirements of the EU AI Act. However, it could have provided more specific information about the solutions adopted for each requirement."
Is a copy of the EU declaration of conformity included in the documentation?,4," The question is partially answered. The technical aspects of the AI system, including data preprocessing, model training, and data splitting, are well-documented and explained in detail. However, there is no specific mention of including a copy of the EU declaration of conformity in the documentation, which is a legal requirement. This documentation lacks clarity on whether the EU declaration of conformity is included or not."
Is there a detailed description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance in the post-market phase?,4," The question is well addressed in the technical documentation. The documentation provides a detailed description of the system's performance evaluation in the post-market phase. It explains the data source, pre-processing, and training procedures, including steps taken to ensure fairness and non-discrimination. It also describes the data splitting process and the variables used in the dataset. The documentation is clear and provides comprehensive insights into the system's operations. However, it could benefit from explicitly mentioning the evaluation metrics used to assess the system's performance in the post-market phase."
Does the description of the system to evaluate the AI system's performance include a post-market monitoring plan as referred to in Article 61(3)?,4," The question is partially answered. The technical documentation provides detailed information about the system's performance evaluation in the post-market phase, including the monitoring plan. It describes the procedures, methodologies, and commitments for continuous evaluation of the system's performance. However, it does not explicitly mention Article 61(3) or directly refer to a post-market monitoring plan as required. The documentation could be improved by explicitly addressing the legal requirement and providing more specific details about the post-market monitoring plan."
